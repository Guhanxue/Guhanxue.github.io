About me: I am a 5th year Ph.D. student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at Duke University, working at the intersection of AI and Healthcare. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Maciej A. Mazurowski](https://sites.duke.edu/mazurowski/) under [Duke Spark Initiative](https://spark.duke.edu/). My research sits at the intersection of machine learning and healthcare, with a focus on developing and adapting deep learning methods for medical image analysisâ€”from application-oriented tools to foundational advancements.

I am interested in several research topics, including foundation models, self- and semi-supervised learning, image harmonization, and clinically meaningful AI. My work spans segmentation, registration, 2D-to-3D reconstruction, and risk prediction. See my Research Topics Bar for details.

Before starting my Ph.D., I received my Bachelorâ€™s degree from Zhejiang University, where I studied Electrical & Information Engineering and minored in ACEE under the Chu Kochen Honors College. Prior to Duke, I spent a year as a research intern at the [Athinoula A. Martinos Center for Biomedical Imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH)](https://www.martinos.org/), where I worked on optical image reconstruction and deep learning.

See my [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=aGjCpQUAAAAJ&hl=en) for a full list of my publications, with a few highlights shown below.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hanxue-gu-24882a22a/) or contact me through emailâ€” Iâ€™m always happy to chat! (ðŸ¤—)

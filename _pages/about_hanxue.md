About me: Machine learning researcher specializing in deep learning for medical imaging. My Ph.D. research focuses on developing and adapting **foundation models (e.g., VFMs, VLMs)**, leveraging **self-/semi-supervised learning (e.g., MAE, DINO, CLIP)**, and applying **parameter-efficient fine-tuning** techniques, transformer architectures, and generative models for tasks like segmentation and registration; developing clinical models for outcome prediction and risk stratification. I have hands-on experience with PyTorch, MONAI, HuggingFace Transformers, and Diffusion Models, and have built pipelines that integrate de-identification, 3D medical image processing (e.g., NIfTI/DICOM), and multimodal data fusion. Passionate about bridging research and real-world clinical deployment, I work at the intersection of AI, imaging, and healthcare to develop models that are robust, interpretable, and clinically relevant.

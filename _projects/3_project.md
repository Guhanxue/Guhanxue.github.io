We quantify body composition from CT and MRI to support:
- **Prediction of chronic disease risk**: cardiovascular, diabetes, cancer.
- **Detection of hormonal and metabolic disorders**.
- **Pre-surgical frailty assessment** and risk stratification.

These imaging biomarkers provide interpretable, explainable clinical indicators.

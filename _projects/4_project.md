We extend our work to broader clinical imaging domains, including:

- **Tumor segmentation, detection, and monitoring** from CT and MRI.
- **Breast and abdominal imaging** using multi-sequence AI pipelines.
- **Image-based biomarker extraction** for diagnosis, prognosis, and other clinical usage.

Our goal is to build **interpretable, robust, and deployable tools** for real-world practice.

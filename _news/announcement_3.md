ðŸ¦´ Thrilled to announce that **"SegmentAnyBone: A Universal Model that Segments Any Bone at Any Location on MRI"** has been accepted to _Medical Image Analysis_!

This work presents the first generalized MRI bone segmentation model across anatomical regions and MRI sequences. Thank you to all collaborators!

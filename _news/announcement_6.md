🩺 Excited to share that our paper “Breast density in MRI: an AI-based quantification and relationship to assessment in mammography” has been accepted for publication in npj Breast Cancer!

In this study, we developed an AI-driven pipeline to quantify breast density directly from MRI scans and explored how these MRI-derived metrics relate to traditional density assessments from mammography. Our work provides new insights into leveraging MRI for more comprehensive breast density evaluation.

Huge thanks to all co-authors and collaborators — looking forward to seeing this work published soon!

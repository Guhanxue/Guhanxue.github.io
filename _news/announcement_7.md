ðŸŽ‰ Thrilled to share that **two of our papers** on breast MRI have been accepted to the **Deep-Breath Workshop at MICCAI 2025**!

ðŸ§  The first paper presents **the most comprehensive breast MRI segmentation dataset to date**, covering a wide range of anatomical structures. We hope this effort can lay the foundation for future research in **breast composition analysis**, **risk stratification**, and **AI-driven screening tools**.

ðŸŒ€ The second paper focuses on **generalizable breast MRI registration**, addressing the challenge of aligning highly deformable anatomy across patients and imaging sessions. We demonstrate the power of **foundation model features** and **training-free registration strategies** to enable robust alignment without manual annotation.

We believe these works together push toward more **generalizable, scalable, and interpretable tools** for breast MRI analysis.

ðŸš€ Stay tuned â€” datasets, code, and more resources will be released soon. Big thanks to the Deep-Breath organizers and all our co-authors and collaborators!
